# Sphere

Sphere is suppost to be a 2D game engine written in C, planning to make it platform independent.
A fully featured game engine - whatever that means to you - is an immense 
project and hard, if not impossible, to handle by one person. So hopefully this 
project will gradually improve alongside my C skills.
